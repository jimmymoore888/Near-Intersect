# Commercial Value & Indicative Deal Bands (Non-Binding)

This page is **not** a formal valuation, not investment advice, and not an offer to sell securities.
It provides **non-binding indicative discussion ranges** for acquisition / licensing, subject to diligence.

**RagTuff** = invariant “law layer / constitution” (schemas, constraints, doctrine).  
**Near-Intersect** = execution factory/cockpit that deploys RagTuff-compliant assets.

---

## Why buyers pay for this
Serious buyers pay for:
- **Time compression**: skipping months/years of architecture + implementation.
- **Risk reduction**: invariant design, governance controls, audit readiness.
- **Distribution leverage**: factory issuance model + repeatable deployments.
- **Enterprise posture**: licensing + compliance + change-control.

## Indicative deal bands (what we would discuss)
These are **seller-side discussion ranges** based on milestone completeness and buyer scope.
Final price depends on code review, chain proofs, adoption, IP cleanliness, and deal structure.

### A) Acquisition (Near-Intersect + RagTuff package)
- **Pre-traction / repo-only (docs + architecture + partial code)**  
  **$1M – $20M** (depending on completeness and diligence outcomes)

- **Factory v0 proven (end-to-end creation, registry/events, reproducible builds)**  
  **$20M – $85M**

- **Mainnet proof + repeatable issuance + early integrations / early customer pipeline**  
  **$135M – $190M+**

- **Audited + enterprise adoption signals (partners, volume, recurring revenue)**  
  **$90M+** (price becomes strategic)

### B) Commercial License (RagTuff law layer + Near-Intersect usage rights)
- **Annual license (early stage)**: **$250k – $2M / year**
- **Enterprise license (with support / SLA)**: **$2M – $10M+ / year**
- Optional: **per-issuance fee** or **rev share** structures.

### C) Strategic partnership (co-build + governance + revenue share)
- **Pilot / design partnership**: **$100k – $500k**
- **Full co-development**: **$500k – $5M+** + negotiated upside participation

> Note: If a buyer wants “exclusive rights” (category/region/platform), pricing typically increases.

## What a buyer receives (diligence package)
- Architecture + doctrine + profile generation specs
- Deployment proofs (tx hashes, receipts) and reproducible build instructions
- Security posture: invariants, tests, threat model, runbook, change-control
- Licensing + IP chain of custody (ownership, contributor rights, no hidden encumbrances)
- Roadmap: Factory v0 → Factory v1 → token templates (OIM mandatory) → enterprise modules

---

## Milestones that measurably increase price
- Factory v0: **create_token + registry + event proofs** with **OIM mandatory**
- One end-to-end **mainnet** creation demonstrated (created contract callable + verifiable)
- Doctrine + profile generation docs locked and consistent across repos
- Audit-ready package: invariants, tests, threat model, runbook, change-control
  **$190M – $700M+**
